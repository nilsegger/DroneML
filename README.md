# DRONE ML

This repository was created for a course at ETH called Optimization Methods.
Our goal was to create a neural network which would control a drone given position, rotation, speed, etc as inputs.

Unfortunately the time scope and complexity of the project did not match.

Following is a video of our final progress. The drone is given its position and is trying to fly towards its next target position given by the sphere.
