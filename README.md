# DRONE ML

This repository was created for a course at ETH called Optimization Methods.
Our goal was to create a neural network which would control a drone given position, rotation, speed, etc as inputs.

Sadly the time scope and complexity of the project got out of hand and had to be replaced. 

Following is a video of our final progress.
